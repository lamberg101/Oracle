Section 2.1, "OPatch Utility"

2.1 OPatch Utility
You must use the OPatch utility version 12.2.0.1.17 or later to apply this patch. Oracle recommends that you use the latest released OPatch version for 12.2, which is available for download from My Oracle Support patch 6880880 by selecting the 12.2.0.1.0 release.

For information about OPatch documentation, including any known issues, see My Oracle Support Document 293369.1 OPatch documentation list.

3 Installation
These instructions are for all Oracle Database installations.

Section 3.1, "Patch Pre-Installation Instructions"

Section 3.2, "Patch Installation Instructions"

Section 3.3, "Patch Post-Installation Instructions"

Section 3.4, "Patch Post-Installation Instructions for Databases Created or Upgraded after Installation of this patch in the Oracle Home"

3.1 Patch Pre-Installation Instructions
Before you install Database Apr 2019 Release Update Revision 12.2.0.1.191015, perform the following actions to check the environment and to detect and resolve any interim patch conflicts.

Section 3.1.1, "Applying Database RU and the Oracle JavaVM Component 12.2.0.1.x Release Update Patch"

Section 3.1.2, "Environments with Grid Infrastructure"

Section 3.1.3, "Environment Checks"

Section 3.1.4, "Interim Patch Conflict Detection and Resolution"

3.1.1 Applying Database 12.2.0.1.x Updates/Revisions with Oracle JavaVM 12.2.0.1.x Updates
The Oracle JavaVM 12.2.0.1.x Release Update is available as a separate patch. That separate patch has some additional requirements if it is to be installed in a "Conditional Rolling Install" fashion, as detailed in My Oracle Support Document 2217053.1. For customers who want to install both patches together during a single downtime window, follow one of the Patching Options listed in the My Oracle Support Document 1929745.1 - Oracle JavaVM Component Database PSU and RU" (OJVM PSU and OVJM RU) Patches.

3.1.2 Environments with Grid Infrastructure
This patch is not to be installed to an environment that has a Grid Infrastructure (GI) home. Please refer to the following My Oracle Support Document 756671.1 to determine the appropriate Grid Infrastructure patch to be installed.

3.1.3 Environment Checks
Ensure that the $PATH definition has the following executables: make, ar, ld, and nm.

The location of these executables depends on your operating system. On many operating systems, they are located in /usr/ccs/bin, in which case you can set your PATH definition as follows:

export PATH=$PATH:/usr/ccs/bin
3.1.4 Interim Patch Conflict Detection and Resolution
The fastest and easiest way to determine whether you have interim patches in the Oracle home that conflict with Database Apr 2019 Release Update Revision 12.2.0.1.191015, and to get the necessary conflict resolution patches, is to use the Patch Recommendations and Patch Plans features on the Patches & Updates tab in My Oracle Support. These features work in conjunction with the My Oracle Support Configuration Manager. Recorded training sessions on these features can be found in Document 603505.1.

However, if you are not using My Oracle Support Patch Plans, the My Oracle Support Conflict Checker tool enables you to upload an OPatch inventory and check the patches that you want to apply to your environment for conflicts.

If no conflicts are found, you can download the patches. If conflicts are found, the tool finds an existing resolution to download. If no resolution is found, it will automatically request a resolution, which you can monitor in the Plans and Patch Requests region of the Patches & Updates tab.

For more information, see Knowledge Document 1091294.1, How to use the My Oracle Support Conflict Checker Tool.

Or, use the following steps to manually discover conflicts and resolutions:

Determine whether any currently installed interim patches conflict with the patch being installed, 30087848:

unzip p30087848_122010_Linux-x86-64.zip
cd 30087848
opatch prereq CheckConflictAgainstOHWithDetail -ph ./
The report indicates the patches that conflict and the patches that are a superset.

Use My Oracle Support Document 1321267.1 Database Patch conflict resolution to determine, for each conflicting patch, whether a conflict resolution patch is already available, and if you need to request a new conflict resolution patch or if the conflict may be ignored.

When all the interim patches that you have requested are available at My Oracle Support, proceed with Section 3.2, "Patch Installation Instructions".

3.2 Patch Installation Instructions
Follow these steps:

If you are using a Data Guard Physical Standby database, you must install this patch on both the primary database and the physical standby database, as described by My Oracle Support Document 278641.1.

If this is a RAC environment, install this patch using the OPatch rolling (no downtime) installation method as this patch is rolling RAC installable. Refer to My Oracle Support Document 244241.1 Rolling Patch - OPatch Support for RAC.

If this is not a RAC environment, shut down all instances and listeners associated with the Oracle home that you are updating. For more information, see Oracle Database Administrator's Guide.

Set your current directory to the directory where the patch is located and then run the OPatch utility by entering the following commands:

unzip p30087848_<version>_<platform>.zip
cd 30087848
opatch apply
If there are errors, refer to Section 5, "Known Issues".

3.3 Patch Post-Installation Instructions
After installing the patch, perform the following actions:

Apply conflict resolution patches as explained in Section 3.3.1.

Load modified SQL files into the database, as explained in Section 3.3.2.

Upgrade Oracle Recovery Manager Catalog, as explained in Section 3.3.3.

3.3.1 Apply Conflict Resolution Patches
Apply the patch conflict resolution interim patches that were determined to be needed when you performed the steps in Section 3.1.4, "interim Patch Conflict Detection and Resolution".

3.3.2 Load Modified SQL Files into the Database
The following steps load modified SQL files into the database. For a RAC environment, perform these steps on only one node.

Datapatch is run to complete the post-install SQL deployment for the patch being installed. For further details about Datapatch, including Known Issues and workarounds to common problems, see: Datapatch: Database 12c Post Patch SQL Automation (Doc ID 1585822.1).

For each separate database running on the same shared Oracle home being patched, run the datapatch utility as described in Table 2.

Table 2 Steps to Run the Datapatch Utility for Standalone DB Versus Single/Multitenant (CDB/PDB) DB

Steps	Standalone DB	Steps	Single/Multitenant (CDB/PDB) DB

% cd $ORACLE_HOME/OPatch



7

% ./datapatch -verbose

            Footnote 1 It is recommended the Post Install step be run on all pluggable databases; however, the following command (SQL> alter pluggable database PDB_NAME open ) could be substituted to only open certain PDBs in the single/multitenant database. Doing so will result in the Post Install step only being run on the CDB and opened PDB's. To update a pluggable database at a later date (skipped or newly plugged in), open the database using the alter pluggable database command mentioned previously and rerun the datapatch utility. See My Oracle Support Document 1935365.1  Multitenant Unplug/Plug Best Practices for more information about the procedure for unplugging/plugging with different patch releases (in both directions).

The datapatch utility runs the necessary apply scripts to load the modified SQL files into the database. An entry is added to the dba_registry_sqlpatch view reflecting the patch application. In the dba_registry_sqlpatch view, verify the Status for the APPLY is "SUCCESS". For any other status, refer to the following My Oracle Support note for additional information and actions: Document 1609718.1 Datapatch Known Issues.

Check the following log files in $ORACLE_BASE/cfgtoollogs/sqlpatch/30087848/<unique patch ID> for errors:

30087848_apply_<database SID>_<CDB name>_<timestamp>.log
where database SID is the database SID, CDB name is the name of the multitenant container database, and timestamp is of the form YYYYMMMDD_HH_MM_SS.

For databases that have invalid objects after the execution of datapatch, run utlrp.sql to revalidate those objects.

Example:
cd $ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin
sqlplus /nolog
SQL> CONNECT / AS SYSDBA
SQL> @utlrp.sql
3.3.3 Upgrade Oracle Recovery Manager Catalog
If you are using the Oracle Recovery Manager, the catalog needs to be upgraded. Enter the following command to upgrade it. The UPGRADE CATALOG command must be entered twice to confirm the upgrade.

$ rman catalog username/password@alias
RMAN> UPGRADE CATALOG;
RMAN> UPGRADE CATALOG;
RMAN> EXIT;
3.4 Patch Post-Installation Instructions for Databases Created or Upgraded after Installation of this patch in the Oracle Home
You must execute the steps in Section 3.3.2, "Loading Modified SQL Files into the Database" for any new database. There are no actions required for databases that have been upgraded.

For more information, see My Oracle Support, 12.1:DBCA(Database Creation) does not execute ”datapatch (Doc ID 2084676.1).
